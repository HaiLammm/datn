# NFR Assessment: 1.1

Date: 2025-12-11
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - File type validation implemented but no rate limiting
- Performance: CONCERNS - 5MB limit set but no response time targets
- Reliability: PASS - Error handling present with proper status codes
- Maintainability: PASS - Good structure and test coverage

## Critical Issues

1. **No rate limiting** (Security)
   - Risk: Potential abuse of upload endpoint
   - Fix: Add rate limiting middleware

2. **Unknown performance targets** (Performance)
   - Risk: No baseline for acceptable upload times
   - Fix: Define and measure response time SLAs
