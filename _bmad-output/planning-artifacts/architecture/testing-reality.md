# Testing Reality

## Current Test Coverage

-   Unit tests for `auth` and `users` modules are expected, but not explicitly analyzed here.
-   Integration tests for CV upload, AI analysis triggering, and status/results retrieval would be critical.
-   The PRD mentions: "Implement critical integration tests for the core AI pipeline during MVP."

## Running Tests

-   Backend: `pytest` (e.g., `pytest backend/tests/`).
-   Frontend: `jest` (e.g., `npm test`).
