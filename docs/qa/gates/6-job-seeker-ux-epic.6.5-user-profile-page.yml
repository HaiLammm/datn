  - severity: high
    description: 'Unit test suite is failing. The test "RecentCVsPreview › With CVs › shows correct count in title" has failed, preventing a merge.'
    file: 'frontend/features/cv/components/RecentCVsPreview.test.tsx'
    recommendation: 'Fix the failing test. The test expects the title "CV gần đây" but the component renders "Gần đây". This regression must be resolved before the review can continue.'

  - severity: medium
    description: 'Significant discrepancy in test reporting. Story claims 38 tests, but 343 were run. This indicates a process failure where the developer did not run the full test suite.'
    file: 'docs/stories/6.5.story.md'
    recommendation: 'Developers must run and pass the entire test suite, not just tests for the current story, before submitting for review. Update development workflow checklists.'
