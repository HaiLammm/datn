- Frontend: 1 risk
- Database: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Category | Title | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|-------|-------------|--------|-------|------------|
| SEC-001 | Security | Insufficient file type validation | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Backend validates MIME type, frontend also checks |
| DATA-001 | Data | File corruption during interrupted uploads | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | No resume mechanism, but files saved atomically |
| PERF-001 | Performance | Large file uploads causing timeouts | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | 5MB limit, but no timeout handling |
| TECH-001 | Technical | Storage path not existing | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Code creates directory if missing |
| SEC-002 | Security | Path traversal via filename | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Uses UUID for filename, not user input |
| OPS-001 | Operational | Storage full | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | No check for available space |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- None

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- None

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Test file upload with interrupted connection
- Test upload when storage is near full
- Test invalid file types thoroughly
- Integration test for full upload flow

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- None

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Monitor storage usage
- Add timeout handling for uploads

### Accepted Risks

- File corruption on interrupt (low probability, medium impact)
