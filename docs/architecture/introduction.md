# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the AI Recruitment Platform, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

The project is built upon an existing full-stack web application with a Python/FastAPI backend and a Next.js/React frontend. The current project state focuses exclusively on a complete and secure user authentication and registration system. Core business features for CV analysis and job matching are planned as a major enhancement.
